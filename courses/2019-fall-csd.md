## Course Outline

In this course the students will learn the fundamentals of C++ language and practice programming skills by writing many exercise programs in a good coding style. They will also learn and practice using development tools and editors in Unix / Linux environment. Through homework and exercise problems the students will study how to write concise programs in more efficient and more creative ways.
* Through C ++, students will learn key concepts of object-oriented programming such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, and have the ability to develop simple text-based programs. They will also learn about references, pointers, dynamic allocation, and so on, to get a deeper understanding of how computer programs work.
