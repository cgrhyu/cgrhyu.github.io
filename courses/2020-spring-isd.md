## Course Outline

The first year students will learn the basics about computer programming. This course introduces C and Python programming languages.
* With Python, you will learn the main concepts of programming such as variables, operators, loops, conditional statements, functions, etc., and have the ability to develop simple text-based games.
* In addition to learning the main concepts of programming through C, you will also learn how to represent data, pointers, and dynamic allocation of memory to gain a deeper understanding of how computer programs work.
* Understand common parts of programming languages and parts that may be different for each language by writing Python and C code for the same programs, and through this, deepen understanding of programming languages.
