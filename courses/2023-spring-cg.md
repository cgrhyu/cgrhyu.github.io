## Course Outline

This course introduces the basic principles of computer graphics and the necessary mathematical concepts. 
Topics incldues the movement and placement of objects (transformation), representation of shapes and appearance of 3D objects, representation of object or chracter animation, rendering pipeline, etc.
In lab sessions, students learn how to use modern OpenGL, and are given time to check the concept of computer graphics learned in the lectures by writing their own modern OpenGL program.
Unlike in previous years, modern OpenGL is used in the lab sessions and assignments, instead of legacy OpenGL.
