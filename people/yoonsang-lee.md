I am an assistant professor in the [Department Of Computer Science](http://cs.hanyang.ac.kr/) at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/).

From 2016-2017. I was an assistant professor at School of Software of Kwangwoon University in Seoul, Korea. Before my academic career, I worked for Software Center (SWC) of Samsung Electronics in 2014-2015 as a senior engineer, and participated in the development of Tizen OS. I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from Seoul National University in 2014 and B.S. degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Seoul National University in 2007.

## Research Interests
I've been interested in a wide range of topics about various types of movements and their underlying mechanisms, in from virtual environment to real-world. In addition, computational design using 3d printers draws my interest these days.

**Physically-Based Character Control**  
We haven't seen a game with fully-simulated characters although the character control technique has been dramatically advanced for recent 10 years. Even state-of-art controllers cannot deal with every situation a character might meet and are not enoughly robust to be employed by such real-time interactive commercial products. I strongly believe there is much room for improvement of those techniques.

**Understanding Human Body / Movement**  
Recent progress of simulation / control techniques allows us to further understand humans. For example, we can simulate human walking with musculoskeletal system and estimate importance of each muscle. This approach can be valuable for relevant areas such as biomechanics or medical field. More understanding of humans also allows us to enhance movements of virtual characters or humanoid robots.

**Humanoid robots**  
From global IT companies to general public, robots are getting more attention these days. Among various robots, I have a major interest in humanoid robots, as they are human-friendly and can use human tools. Based on my experience on controllers in virtual world, I'm planning to design controllers for real-world humanoid robots focusing on the naturalness of motion, which can be related to efficiency and safety.

**Computational Design**  
3D printing is getting more popular and its applications are getting wider. Now 3D printers can print toys, food, bicycles, automobiles, parts of a jet engine, and building blocks for a house. It's lowering the entry barriers for manufacturing, thus the number of hardware startups is rapidly increasing these days. I believe we're seeing the beginning of a new era of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing. From a research point of view, there are plenty of chances to develop novel techniques / applications using 3D printing.

## Engineering Interests
Additionally, I'm interested in dealing with practical engineering problems with which one can easily face in development process in IT industries. I'd like to call some of them as my "engineering interests".

**Development & Management for Libraries**  
Writing code for libraries for products is a totally different task from writing code for research. The code should be much more robust, handle all of the exceptional cases, and have enough test code. Public APIs should be carefully selected, since one should always consider backward compatibility on source and binary level once the API is opened.

**Super-Easy Application Development**  
The competitiveness of a platform is directly related to how many apps are available on it, how many developers are writing apps for it. I'm interested in developing the easiest application development process / environment in which even a novice user can make a commercial-level apps.

**Effective Co-working through Network**  
The world is getting more and more connected, and it's also true for development processes. We're facing more and more chances to work with co-workers at different locations on the earth. I'm interested in how to maximize such co-working effectiveness using cooperative development tools such as git or gerrit.

**Scripting to Remove Unnecessary Repetitive Work**  
Focusing on their key competitiveness is always important for every person and company. But there usually are repetitive tasks that spend our time instead of focusing on key factors. With several years of intensive experiences of Python script language, I'm always trying to remove such tasks by writing scripts.
