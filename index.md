Our research group aims to understand various aspects (movements, structure designs, underlying mechanisms, etc.) of natural or artificial creatures (humans, animals,  robots, etc.) and realize them in from virtual environment to real world.

Our research interests include:

* Learning control policies for virtual characters / physical robots
* Generative models for human motion synthesis
* Understanding human body / movement mechanisms
* Other cutting-edge computer graphics / robotics technologies
